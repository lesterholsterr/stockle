# Stockle v0.1.0 - Bear Trap

A stock market-themed wordle parody currently in open Alpha. After almost a year hiatus, I'm back. You thought this project was left for dead, but it was just a [bear trap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beartrap.asp) ðŸ˜‰.

Check it out at https://playstockle.com.

*Currently down for maintenance. Hoping to have a stable release by Halloween.

### Deployment

Stockle runs on Node, but it scrapes financial data from the web using Python. I used Docker to containerise this app into a Python virtual environment inside a node based image (please do not ask how long this took). The Docker image was pushed to Amazon's Elastic Container Registry. An ECS container is running this image on a single EC2 t2.micro instance, so please don't DDOS me. The domain is registered with Amazon's Route 53 and points to a Cloudfront distribution that has the EC2 instance as its origin. Nginx reverse proxies HTTP requests to port 8080, where the server is listening for inbound traffic.
