# Stockle

A stock market themed wordle clone I am attempting to build.

### Sources
Popup window CSS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8fAO_zyFAM&t=24s

Search bar implementation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd7s7egjt30&t=3s

Board styling and use of AppContext: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDTNwmXUz2c

(Maybe) Dropdown menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaMgXmrk29M

### TODO
Replace png images with react icons when possible

Implement the graph (is an API required for this?)

Make the stock automatically change each day (and make a list of "reasonable" stocks to choose from)

Easy/Hard mode option (toggle stock chart)

Dark/Light mode option


### Future Improvements
Actually deploy the damn thing!

Create an account and track statistics (will need to learn nodejs and choose a db)

Search reccomendation priority
