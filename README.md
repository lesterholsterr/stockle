### TODO

#### Front End
Registration/login popup window, connect to backend (with axios?)

Replace menu images with react icons

Add a stock chart (look into APIs)

Easy/Hard mode (toggle graph on/off) and dark/light mode

#### Back End
Make user authentication less scuffed

Look into image hosters to store user profile pictures

Server side logic for storing statistics

Server side logic for daily refresh of stock data (look into date/time related tools)

Make a list of "reasonable" stocks to choose from

#### Long Term
Actually deploy the damn thing!

Search bar reccomendation priority
