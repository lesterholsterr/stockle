### TODO

#### Front End

Local storage board state should refresh when switching between accounts (?)

Add a stock chart (look into APIs)
- https://canvasjs.com/javascript-stockcharts/line-stockchart-json/

Add hint feature (logo)
- https://www.benzinga.com/apis/cloud-product/company-logo-api/

Easy/Hard mode (toggle graph on/off) and dark/light mode

#### Back End

Look into image hosters to store user profile pictures

Server side logic for storing statistics

Server side logic for daily refresh of stock data (look into date/time related libraries)

Make a list of "reasonable" stocks to choose from

#### Long Term

Deploy the damn thing!

Search bar reccomendation priority
