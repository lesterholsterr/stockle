# Stockle

A stock market themed wordle clone I am attempting to build.

### Sources
Popup window CSS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8fAO_zyFAM&t=24s
Search bar implementation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd7s7egjt30&t=3s
(Maybe) Dropdown menu: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaMgXmrk29M
(Maybe) Didn't directly copy anything from this video, but it gave me some good paradigms for how to approach the overall design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDTNwmXUz2c


### Future Improvements
Actually deploy the damn thing!
Dark/Light mode option
Easy/Hard mode option (toggle stock chart)
Create an account and track statistics (will need to learn nodejs and choose a db)
Search reccomendation priority
