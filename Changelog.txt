CHANGE LOG (There's probably a better way to do changelogs on Github... but I'm too lazy to find it. So for now, this will have to do.)

Alpha 1.0.0
- Hello World!

Alpha 1.0.1
- Fixed losing not being able to earn you any points
- Fixed asynchronicity problems resulting in daily reset tasks being executed out of order
- If the randomly generated stock of the day is missing information on Yahoo Finance, it now re-generates one to avoid the white screen of death
- Added meta data to the HTML page
- Added a "View Git Repo" button in the settings popup
- Updated README and added Changelog.txt

Alpha 1.0.2
- As a temporary measure: In order to make guesses, the user must be logged in
- Fixed sector name overflowing to a second line
- Improved sector naming:
    - C. Staples is now Consumer Staples
    - C. Discretion is now Consumer Cyclical
    - Comms is now Communications
- Fixed persistent autocomplete bug (there was a problem with duplicate indexing that somehow made its way to the front-end)
- Fixed data manipulation problem in fetch_basic_data.py which often cleared all info from the stock info database
